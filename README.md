# Copy page title and URL
Allows you to quickly copy pages title or URL.

## What it does:
- Adds "Copy page title and URL" option to tab context menu, and under that menu, two items:
  1. Copy page title
  2. Copy page URL

## What's next
No immediate plans, perhaps adding an option to copy page URL stripped of tracking data.
